# Typographix Gallery

This gallery project will allow us to dive into the complexities of CSS Grid to create a very unique layout that can be customized however you like. We will also revisit this project twice more, to add transitions when hovering over our images to make it feel more interactive, and lastly, to add a unique loading animation when the page loads.
